Any of the images that you don't import directly into your components (example - favicon) should be placed in the public/ folder.


public: anything that is not used by your app when it compiles

src: anything that is used when the app is compiled

So for example if you use an image inside a component, it should be in the src/assets folder but if you have an image outside the app (i.e. favicon) it should be in public.

Files in public directory will not be processed by Webpack. And they won't be a part of the final bundle.
