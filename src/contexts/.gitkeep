The contexts/ (or store/) folder is for all the React context files that are utilized across multiple pages in your project. In larger projects, you'll likely have several contexts that you'll use throughout your application, making this folder an invaluable asset. However, if you're using a distinct global data store, like Redux, you may want to substitute this folder with a more relevant set of folders specifically designed to store your Redux files.
