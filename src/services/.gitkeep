The services/ folder is a common convention for organizing files related to interacting with external APIs or services.

Services are typically used to abstract away the details of interacting with external APIs or services from the rest of the application's code, making it easier to maintain and test. In the services/ folder, you might find code that handles tasks such as authentication, data fetching, and data transformation.
