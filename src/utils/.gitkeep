The utils/ folder is designated for storing all utility functions, such as formatters. The folder is quite straightforward, and all the files contained within should be as well. If you do use a utils/ folder, it's a good practice to organize the code into smaller, more specific subfolders, such as stringUtils, mathUtils, or dateUtils, to make it easier to find and understand the code. It's also important to regularly review and clean up the utils/folder to remove any unnecessary or duplicated code.
